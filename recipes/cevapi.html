    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cevapi (pronounced CHAE-vap or CHAE-vap-ee) is easy to make, 
        grilled sausages from Southeastern Europe that burst with smoky flavor and 
        are perfect for serving with flatbread and sliced onions.</p>
    
    <p>Cevapi are hand-shaped, case-less sausages that are popular in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, 
        and other countries in the Balkans/Southeastern Europe region. </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef, 85% lean</li>
        <li>½ lb ground pork</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 ¼ tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>¾ tsp baking soda</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl mix together all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Using slightly over 1 Tbsp of meat mixture per sausage, 
            shape the mixture into sausages the size and shape of a fat finger 
            (roughly 3 inches long and ¾ of an inch in diameter).</li>
        <li>Place all the formed sausages in a single layer on a platter. 
            Cover the platter and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (up to overnight).</li>
        <li>When you are ready to cook your sausages, preheat your grill to medium heat, 350-400⁰F. 
            (You should be able to hold your hand a few inches from the cooking grate for 5-7 seconds.)</li>
        <li>Grill the sausages using a fine grate grill pan for 4-5 minutes a side, until golden and springy.</li>
        <li>Serve the cevapi with sliced sweet onions and flatbread (like lepinja or pita).</li>
    </ol>
