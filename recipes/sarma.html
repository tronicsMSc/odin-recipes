    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe for Serbian stuffed cabbage, 
        or sarma, is a hearty dish that many Serbs serve every 
        day but especially for special occasions like slavas and other holidays. 
        Recipes vary from cook to cook, but they all consist of a meat filling 
        wrapped in cabbage and cooked over sauerkraut. This recipe includes a 
        tomato sauce for more flavor.</p>
    
    <p>Sarma, or Serbian stuffed cabbage, is a meal in and of itself and needs 
        little accompaniment. A side of fresh bread or potato salad makes it a feast, 
        or try starting with soup like pasulj.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3-to 4-pound) head cabbage</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1 cup raw rice, rinsed</li>
        <li>1 (1.4-ounce) package dehydrated onion soup mix</li>
        <li>1 (32-ounce) jar sauerkraut, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>6 medium smoked ribs, ham hocks, or other smoked meat</li>
        <li>1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (10 3/4-ounce) can tomato soup</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Steam the head of cabbage until the outer leaves are limp, 
            then cool slightly and separate the leaves.</li>
        <li>With a paring knife, remove the tough ribs from the leaves without damaging them. 
            Reserve the tougher outer leaves, but don't use for rolling.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the ground chuck, ground pork, rice, and onion soup mix.</li>
        <li>Adding a small amount of water will make the mixture easier to handle.</li>
        <li>Heap 2 tablespoons of filling onto each steamed, prepared cabbage leaf.</li>
        <li>Fold the bottom of the cabbage leaf up over the meat.</li>
        <li>Fold sides to the center and roll away from yourself to encase completely.</li>
        <li>Repeat until the meat filling is gone.</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 350 F.</li>
        <li>Discard the cabbage core and coarsely chop any remaining cabbage except
             the tough outer leaves you have reserved.</li>
        <li>Spread the chopped cabbage on the bottom of a large casserole dish or Dutch oven. 
            Add the drained sauerkraut.</li>
        <li>Layer on the cabbage rolls, seam-side down.</li>
        <li>Cut the smoked ribs into pieces. Space the ribs or 
            other smoked meat of choice between the cabbage rolls.</li>
        <li>Cover rolls with reserved tough outer leaves.</li>
        <li>Mix tomato sauce and soup with enough water to make a liquidy consistency.</li>
        <li>Pour over rolls until mixture is level with rolls, but not over the top.</li>
        <li>Cover the casserole dish and bake 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Then reduce temperature to 325 F and bake for 2 more hours.</li>
        <li>Let sit 20 to 30 minutes before serving. </li>
    </ol>
