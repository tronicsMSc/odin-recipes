    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Kompot or compot is one of the recipes that I grew up having. 
        My Mum made it every summer using fresh fruit, and then in the winter she made it with dried fruit. 
        Any kind of fruit can work with this, berries, apples, apricots, cherries, you name it!</p>
    
    <p>My favorite thing about this recipe is that you get to drink the juice, 
        and then with a spoon eat the fruit! But feel free to strain the juice if you prefer.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>fruit (fresh, frozen or dried)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash fruits, and pit any stone fruit that youâ€™re using.</li>
        <li>Fill a pot with water, and bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add fruit, and cook uncovered for 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Switch the heat off, and add sugar to taste. </li>
        <li>Serve the juice warm (during winter), or chilled!</li>
    </ol>
